## Ingredients

- 4 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream or milk
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh chives, chopped (optional)
- Grated cheese (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Eggs
1. Crack eggs into a bowl
2. Add cream or milk and whisk gently until just combined
3. Season with salt and pepper
4. Don't over-whisk - you want to keep some texture

### Step 2: Cook the Eggs
1. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat
2. Add butter and let it melt completely
3. Pour in the egg mixture
4. Let it sit for 30 seconds without stirring

### Step 3: Create the Perfect Texture
1. Using a spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges toward the center
2. Continue this motion, allowing uncooked egg to flow to the edges
3. Cook until eggs are just set but still slightly runny
4. Remove from heat immediately - they'll continue cooking from residual heat

### Step 4: Serve
1. Transfer to warm plates
2. Garnish with fresh chives and extra black pepper
3. Serve immediately while hot and creamy

## Pro Tips

- **Low and Slow**: The key is cooking over medium-low heat
- **Don't Overcook**: Remove from heat when eggs are still slightly runny
- **Quality Matters**: Use fresh, room-temperature eggs for best results
- **Butter is Key**: Don't skimp on the butter - it adds richness and prevents sticking

## Variations

- **Cheesy Eggs**: Add grated cheddar or parmesan in the last 30 seconds
- **Herb Eggs**: Mix in fresh herbs like parsley, dill, or basil
- **Creamy Eggs**: Add a dollop of cream cheese for extra richness
- **Spicy Eggs**: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes or hot sauce

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **High Heat**: This creates rubbery, dry eggs
2. **Over-whisking**: Breaks down the protein structure
3. **Overcooking**: Eggs should be creamy, not dry
4. **Cold Pan**: Always preheat the pan properly
